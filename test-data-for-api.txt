        "summary": "This is a fun little curious collection of Cap stories in their original graphic form, printed in color in mass market format. It appeared in 1979, long before the internet, and even long before there were such things as easily accessible comics stores in every city or volumes of comics readily available in libraries, so it was a terrific way of introducing people to comics who had otherwise not had the opportunity. It kicks off with the Cap-joining-the-Avengers story, and continues with a couple of contemporary stories before back-tracking to some of the better Cap & Bucky adventures by Lee & Kirby from the 1960s. (You know, when Bucky was still dead.) Great, classic stuff, but in a format you needed a magnifying glass to read. Face front, true believers! Excelsior!",
